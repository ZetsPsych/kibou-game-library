# Kibou Game Library
Kibou Game Library is a (sort of) customizable free open source game launcher app for android phones. This project started with the intention of having something that worked in the way I use Steam or other launchers- to have a centralized app that had all my gaming gaming software. Also android folders are ugly. But yeah, it's technically a glorified folder.
Please bear in mind that I started this piece of shit app back when I was just training with android so the code may not be as polished as I'd like.

# Current Features
> Add apps and launch it
> Select the size / amount of icons per row
> Set a custom wallpaper
> Set a custom App Title (tho it's buggy)

# Future Features
> Select multiple apps
> Customize icon position
> Fix all bugs, hopefully. Eventually.
